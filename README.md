# DebitMyData (DMD) Core

DebitMyData addresses the "post-subsidy" security challenge by implementing supply epochs. Instead of relying solely on transaction fees for long-term security, DMD ensures that mining remains a permanent, viable infrastructure through predictable, recurring issuance cycles.

### Key Features

* **Cyclical Issuance:** 21 Million DMD supply per epoch (~45.66 years).
* **SHA-256 Algorithm:** Utilizing the world's most secure and mature hashing standard.
* **LWMA-3 Difficulty Adjustment:** Responsive adjustment on every block to maintain stable 150-second block times.
* **Data Anchoring:** Native support for **100kb OP_RETURN**, facilitating decentralized notarization.
* **Advanced Privacy & Security:** Default **BIP324 (v2 Transport)** encrypted P2P communication.
* **Quantum-Ready Foundation:** Transition-ready architecture using **Pay-to-Merkle-Root (P2MR)**.
